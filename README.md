# Projet Navigation
#third assignment of the semester
#This assignment will helped me understand how to inject small HTML files into an index.html page. I also implemented a new way to navigate using the URL instead of the href.
#5 pages with content with images and text. I duplicated a site I liked. 
#this is on the web 4 server and to Github as well.
